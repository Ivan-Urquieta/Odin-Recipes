<h1><strong>Calabrian Chilli & Red Bell Pepper Pasta [Vegetarian]</strong></h1>
<img src="./images/rbp.png">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This weeknight dinner is bursting with flavor thanks to some Calabrian Chillis,
     roasted Red Bell peppers, and plenty of Garlic. You'll be hooked on
    the creamy and rich flavor that comes from the roasted red bell peppers and the sweet heat from
    the Calabrian Chillis.</p>
<p>Although this recipe is listed as Vegetarian, don't hesitate to fix it to your liking.
    If you're Vegan swap out the heavy cream for some preferred alternative such as Oat Milk, 
    and for those that want meat, add your preferred meat.
</p>
<p>I recommend a larger sized pasta such as Penne or even Faralle,
    something that would hold the sauce well when coated. Choosing a larger pasta also helps
    make the dish look more filling and appealing. 
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<il><strong>450 grams</strong> pasta like Penne or Farfalle </il><br>
<il><strong>2</strong> Red Bell Peppers</il><br>
<il><strong>3 tbsp</strong> Olive Oil</il><br>
<il><strong>1/2</strong> Yellow Onion,<em> finely chopped</em></il><br>
<il><strong>4</strong> Garlic cloves,<em> minced</em></il><br>
<il><strong>1 tbsp </strong> Tomato Paste</il><br>
<il><strong>1 tsp</strong> Smoked Paprika</il><br>
<il><strong>2 cup</strong> Heavy Cream</il><br>
<il><strong>1 cup</strong> Parmigiano Reggiano</il><br>
<il><strong>1 tbsp</strong> Chopped Calabrian Chilli's w/ oil from jar</il><br>
<il><strong>Season to taste</strong> Salt, Black Pepper</il><br>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Directions</strong></h4>
<ol>
<il><strong>Step 1. Prepare the peppers</strong></il>
<p>Set the oven's broiler to high. Cut the peppers in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds and stems, then place the halves cut-side down.
Broil the peppers until the skins are completely blackened. Alternatively, if you have a gas stovetop, carefully char the whole peppers directly over the flame.
Transfer the charred peppers to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap or a dish towel. Let them steam for 10 minutes.
When the peppers are still warm but cool enough to handle, remove the skins—they should peel off easily. Cut the bell peppers into strips and set aside.</p>
<il><strong>Step 2. Making the sauce</strong></il>
<p>Start by bringing a pot of water to boil. In a large saucepan bring the heat to medium and add the 3 tablespoons of oil. 
Follow with the finely chopped onion and a pinch of salt. Cook the onions until softened and translucent, stirring occasionally.
Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Follow with the finely chopped onion and a pinch of salt. 
Cook until softened, stirring occasionally. Then toss in the bell peppers and stir for about a minute, until the onions start to brown slightly.
Then stir in the Garlic and Calabrian Chillis, cook briefly until fragrant, no more than a minute. 
Then add the tomato paste and cook an additional minute until it darkens in color, stirring frequently.
Next add the heavy cream to the mix and let it simmer until the cream thickens and all those flavors marry. Season with Salt and Pepper to taste.
After the cream has thickened up, toss it all into a blender and purée. Once all blended bring to a light simmer.
While the sauce simmers, add a generous amount of salt to the boiling water and follow with the pasta. Stir for a few seconds to prevent sticking. 
Cook the pasta until just shy of al dente—usually a couple of minutes before the package directions—and taste a piece every so often to check for doneness.
</p>
<il><strong>3. Finish the dish and Enjoy!</strong></il>
<p>Transfer the pasta directly to the sauce, along with a spoonful of pasta water. Turn the heat back on to medium-low and toss to coat. 
Cook the pasta in the sauce for another minute or two to meld the flavors. Add more pasta water to loosen the sauce as needed. 
Serve immediately, topped with finely grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</p>
