<h1><strong>Cider-Battered Chicken Strips</strong></h1>
<img src="./images/chicken.jpeg">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, the best beer batter isn't made with beer! It's actually done with sparkling apple cider, 
which produces a light, beautifully crispy, and very flavorful coating. Not to mention it's super easy.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<il><strong>4</strong> skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </il><br>
<il><strong>1  tsp</strong> kosher salt</il><br>
<il><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> freshly ground black pepper</il><br>
<il><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> cayenne pepper</il><br>
<il><strong>2 tbsp</strong> all-purpose flour</il><br>
<il><strong>1 cup </strong> self-rising flour</il><br>
<il><strong>1 1/4 cups</strong> sparkling apple cider</il><br>
<il><strong>1 quart</strong> canola oil for frying</il><br>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
<il><strong>Step 1.</strong></il>
<p>Cut each chicken breast into 6 finger-sized strips, and transfer into a mixing bowl.</p>
<il><strong>Step 2.</strong></il>
<p>Season with kosher salt, black pepper, and cayenne and toss until evenly coated. 
Sprinkle the all-purpose flour over top and shake the bowl to coat the strips. 
Toss until all the surfaces are completely coated, and then transfer onto a rack or plate. 
Place in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least 10 minutes, or until ready to fry.</p>
<il><strong>Step 3.</strong></il>
<p>Meanwhile, whisk self-rising flour and sparkling apple cider together in a mixing bowl to form a thin batter. 
Batter should be somewhere between a thin pancake batter and a crepe batter, but still thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. 
Place in the refrigerator to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before using.</p>
<il><Strong>Step 4.</Strong></il>
<p> Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
<il><strong>Step 5.</strong></il>
<p> Dip each chicken finger into the batter to coat. Deep-fry in batches in the hot oil until golden brown, 
crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 3 to 4 1/2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately with dipping sauce.</p>
</ol>
<h5>Chef's Notes</h5>
<p>For making homemade self rising flour, you can make your own by adding 1/2 teaspoon salt 
and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder to 1 cup of all purpose flour.
For recipes where you want a more neutral flavor, club soda is a good option.
